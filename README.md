Sudoku Solver
The Sudoku Solver project is an advanced Java application designed to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles. Sudoku is a number puzzle game played on a 9x9 grid, divided into 3x3 subgrids. The objective is to fill in the grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, column, and subgrid contains every digit exactly once.

Key Features
Grid Support:

The solver supports various Sudoku grid configurations, including the standard 9x9 grid and variations like 4x4. This allows users to enjoy solving puzzles of different complexities.
User-Driven Input:

Users have the flexibility to choose the percentage of their input. They can contribute to the initial puzzle by providing either 30% or 70% of the filled cells. This personalizes the solving experience and allows users to control the puzzle's difficulty.
Backtracking Algorithm:

The solver employs a powerful backtracking algorithm to dynamically generate solutions for the remaining cells of the puzzle. This ensures a challenging and well-balanced solving process.
Java Implementation:

Developed entirely in Java, the project leverages the language's readability and versatility to create a robust Sudoku-solving solution.
